# Code Writing Guide - Universal

This repository is to be used for all notes related to good testing, good comments, methodologies, etc.

Repository is a work in progress.  As always at github/mabiesen, master branches contain the latest information.

BIG TIP:  Save yourself some headaches and do all modifications to a project from the command line instead of github.com.  This will insure that at all times the latest version of a project is being updated locally, preventing conflict.
