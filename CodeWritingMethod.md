#Code Writing Methodology

Basic formula for any programming project:

## Once project is started, each functional change to a project should be committed to git control. ##

1. Write down project criteria
2. Work on the easy things first
 * This will help to provide clarity on the harder things
3. Refactor code and comment as the code is written.
4. Create library file for all reusable code in project
 * Doing this will show you how you can further refactor your code.
5. Create test file

On project completion, move all library-worthy code to personal library
