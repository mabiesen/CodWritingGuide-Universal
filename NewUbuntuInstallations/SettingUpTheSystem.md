# Getting Started with Ubuntu

## Downloading Ubuntu
1. Use qTorrent - direct download takes longer and can corrupt the download
2. Download the LTS version if new - Systems with long term support have fewer problems
3. If on Windows, download an application to do a checksum on your download to check for defects
4. Use Unetbootin to download the ISO to usb - I had issues with Win32DiskImager
5. After loaded to usb, reboot your computer and check the disk for defects before using.
6. If no errors were found in the check, try out the installation from the usb without install
7. If all is good, install
